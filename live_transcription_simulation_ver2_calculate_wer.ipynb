i love her songs and i love how she is really humble and you know live her normal life even though of her global success oh taxi drivers they are really interesting people you know they like to they like to talk most interesting is about this guy who talk about all his gambling yes and he will talk about his gambling experiences in marina bay sands so you know it s really it was really funny the guy is such a character and he would just mm okay right beside you okay yes exactly ya to chat with her ya so exactly you know on this point had an experience what sad i was with the force police force and this lady would always call up to the police station and talk about talk about talk about all sorts of things so that was completely about this and complain about that give me one point thanks alright tfr what would you rather have kids orhs why wow you getting all serious with me okay so alright best subject what s that called social studies worst subject a second number a second details um ya so you know what what s i take out on on on on on on success you know the say that love makes the world go round or love is what drives the world i believe that we will bring love to the world rasel p ya so we all go through that period in our primary ah secondary school where we read russian books yes that they are have always been experiencing they do not move out of that circle or that space so what happens is that they do not see the all the other areas which you know could lie which which is there you know so people who plays society and security as a top priority i usually people who may not be as fulfilling ya so basically i just spend my time there lah playing around with all the other kids from the other stall ya it was good good times kaypoh so what s the most busybody thing ever done maybe you can share oh really i i also had a cinderella experience ya the other time i think it was gala i was walking down the road and basically i heard i heard this this boy this boy is right i was just eating like porridge with her friend and there was this banana tree that she actually just sat me down talk me through things and actually forgive me and definitely with the consent of the other students lah so that itself actually made me learn to think more about my own actions primary sec ya ya of course i felt different that the great great impact on me lah of course i love her so much she s like the best teacher you can ever find you know what what about you do you have any ya of course time to time must still visit her bring us some stuff missus jayer ya mm yes precisely that s exact what i learnt as well ya bonding true struggles and also leading with example ya precisely i definitely to the best of my ever ya that s makes you feel good ah ya okay king of fruits what s the most number of durians you have ever eaten at wado do you even eat durian the seeds okay let s do the whole okay let s do seeds ah thirty i try to eat lesser lah but i want i want to stay in shape ya families to where they think they deserve to be of a high level lah bring them a better better life ya so so so okay so if you could send a message to a specific group of singaporean who would you address and what would you say yes gambling habits you know i come to realise that a lot of taxi drivers right they re just i mean right now i would say it s not correct what what they they normally just do this for fun do do you realise that a lot of people who don t have much to do so they re just trying to my neighbour next door is this is wonderful lady she s in her seventies contributed to society she used to be a teacher they are really good lah and good good people ya and well think about her i would say neighbours i would think that okay ya okay ya i get you that s what that s what people say but ya i don t don t really believe in it lah i mean do you ya okay so when was the last time you character with a foreigner or what do you actually talk about full human full human ya i mean definitely if i can full human is when you can achieve something larger hereself like what i told you earlier on basically success that s full human that s interesting ya give you a one point dressing ya i mean i like i like how they use the dress to make comfort one quarter of the and what what what they dress in is definitely more comfortable as compared to while we re wearing right now ya of course economy ya it used to be okay hmm the non happy state of mind yes i get where you re coming from so in a way they re seeking for like physical stimulation to actually compensate for whatever they can t get meant to right okay maybe we can go on to the next question so what was says here so whose the better cook your mum or your grandmother grandma what what sort of dishes mmhmm hello hello hello hello yup yup okay nice nice nice nice okay nice nice it s really they are really working damn hard and like it s a bit crazy they would study harder than any of us can ever study that s why like everyone gets the city not the best because it s ultimately still a bell curve a competition right but um uh but the problem is right i was i was talking about uh back then actually even now lah when you get a degree in china but after he came here uh he was working lah he work for a while my one was having in china uh she still had me like that came here it was part of the construction firm also then uh he got all construction firm then he realised it s a his degree was invalid then uh some business related the mum had me brought uh what we want to know more much earlier we were just seeing one it say it is not too bad that s going for it i i think that s a bit too pretty mature as as much as as much as good as the job sounds and maybe this job would is the best sounding one out of everything but ultimately they haven t told you the sign of contract yet there is too time to think about it because based on shenning is a very bad thing and he always work super hard uh ya lah for the family for himself and he very he doesn t really know how to spend also he works save up a lot of money uh so that s a really good point about him what do you even talk about this in the first place ya he was he was we we we got like a second hand uh hdb hand it was quite expensive also so we were paying off a lot of loans lah car also car loans and stuff like that and uh i think coe price was not very high that point ah it s it s insane now but imagine back when i was primary school i think like when i was primary school i think like when i was primary school i think like when i was primary school i think like when i was primary school i think like when i was primary school i think like when i was primary school i think like when i was primary school i think like when i was primary school i think like when i was primary school i think like when i was primary school i think like when i was primary school i think like when i was primary school i would have to work super hard he always works super hard he always works super hard he always works super hard uh ya lah for the family for himself and he very he doesn t really know how to spend also he works he works he saves up a lot of money uh so that s a really good point about him what he even talked about this in the first place ya he was he was he because we we we we we we we got like uh second hand uh hgpn uh was quite expensive also so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so it s it s really quite it s it s a and that s where he ended up now lah he s still in sales because he he s a high over guy he s quite a versatile change i don t blame him old people are generally a versatile change ya and it s versatile so it s kind of like you can t teach your older old folks that s the issue but it s the same it s the same kind of product that s why that that s why i do this for the i cannot i you know what as in like he s able to back even but not civically more than even he s even earning some not not not significant in amount for the loans that are off as but but my mum is doing quite a but the problem is that they generally buy insurance and stuff like that they are big cause like that lah like that is he s he he doesn t really do a lot of that you get what i mean he doesn t do a lot of plannings so like i have to rely on i guess but are you still planning to send out more send out more uh very chimised so exactly exactly as i say lah where is where is the company ah and what does the company do exactly i still don t understand okay uh where is it that s not too bad eh but we need or sophisticated words you mean not not in tricker in tricker means detail uh uh uh uh can you even describe words as in tricker okay that s a that s a better description no so you you your voice is not oh ya you see your voice sound so singlish so singaporean so singaporean so singaporean ya because you are you are trying to imitate someone who is not singaporean because you are trying to imitate someone is not singaporean that s why it sounds weird because you are singaporean because you sound very singaporean save money okay or get a priority settle first is it okay lor then all all the more i can spend my money happily uh going to expensive places for hikes you will tell me that your job is pa my my impression is that you are just going to do a lot of stuff honestly speaking like oh uh i ll add this to my colleague uh like uh get this memo written up for i will send to this person take the minutes for this meeting then to everyone that that doesn t sound like a job job that s why i get the i get no job better you re you re too you re too okay with things already their terrible mental minds that i have that good mental minds the good mental minds the gen really very very responsive very very very good direction you go with good mental minds to finish the project no time okay no time okay no time that really start studying already my never my mental is dee worst i m not it s four of us like like one or two a bit only okay i honestly kind of excited to start studying also it s like it s like you orh must go to work i m so tired oh i shouldn t have take the second shift then i m like come with the two work okay oh ridiculous like that s why i everytime you say yes i ll like you ll show you what then you say number five easy to share with other people there s a lot of ways in which cloud storage is better no the okay you can the only problem with cloud storage is that moving too big a file that is too big of a uh too big a size is uh depends on the speed of your in life connection and commitment i we should have told them when he came in lah honestly if if you don t want to as in we can tell them that we can tell them that like it was supposed to be but i don t mind staying in bedong i will just get it over and out or is so lazy i m a generator of conversation i keep on generating conversation and ya cause cause storage is in fact better you re paying thirty dollars a year what if we come then then after that we start regretting then that that that will be quite sad and also your your tide at least to the probation period is for the company lah oh that s not too bad that that s a good thing about that lah i guess but uh the downside is that during that period of time you won t be sending any well true true but the only issue is that with that right is that uh no lah in fact it s more secure up on the oops sorry sorry up on the on the cloud storage that it is on a hard disk course you can lose can that means you hard disk to you you hard disk can have perhaps that files it s pretty cool it it s like they already have a lot of things in place if you do you really spend on you lah do you have any files that you want to save don t don t tell me stuff do you vent you can technically still keep go drive lah and if you actually really like go drive that much you just can consider getting a sorry sorry sorry let me google car sorry actually i think dropbox is better than like what we were trying to take like what the but we were going to drive with that it s much easier to have a car uh at it orh uh dropbox is uh the most basic the the one lab work above basic quite gross nine ninety a month bomb and paul s cafe juice i m really feeling quite tired that s quite cute ah i thought you said this is ntu ntu stuff orh to email everyone orh okay that s that s okay that s the most but do you know do you know what this project is about now that s odd i think you missed out one huge part of it that says this kind it s not a cellphone or at least silent mode so you don t vibrate alright then you you you we come up with a common sense topic come we talk about it i won t say anything man save email wah damn cute sia this one it s a woman what woman okay true uh so hard to focus you know you can you can kind of uh topic i send to you first tathmandu tathmandu is damn cool it s like a mixture of uh indian and india and chinese culture uh a lot of mangestas also but then tathmandu is very india like to to the point where it s very very like a lot of people say that it s very crowded very and i don t want to computer because you watch on the computer it s been sad it s even more recent for me to pro procrastinate ah man what dilemma right you can be my personal assistant you can help me that i won t download every single episode i m hungry i m not hungry my stomach is moving oh ya of course have you never been to serangoon it s like it s like it s like buying okay imagine right imagine you re buying investment you won t know about your investment right cause you don t want to it is same thing it s something similar you re putting an investment your investment is the job that you can think this is not a part time job this is a full time job in which you want to gain experience even if you don t want to stay there full time you re gonna it s not any part time job where you just want to earn the money and sell it s it like the place that i was supposed to earn it s pretty good stuff eh but i want to go to the one that i recommend it s still go early no we didn t go early we go right at the time we won the which is around five plus so you want to go uh jb we can go i think two two two months two and a half months time i will be relatively freer cause of uh fam fam handsomest because we were i i have tried asking before i have tried asking before in the place i have asked at least which is not that many i i i give i give it to you but the place i have asked you do not have it what wait not not the current one it s okay what oh okay because different people cook it it s quite inconsistent ya i i always see people cook it i will never i will never really go out to eat bai mian but bai mian is super more ah eh you haven t bought your thing right the the hard disk you buy later lah you want buy later you planning to get a popular right i got popular membership i tell you before what you never pay attention you always forget you don t care i never forget no i always i always remember stuff please please i very excited because the watch so excited i m getting it it s coming on five days left started are you out you want buy or not i swear i was like eighty percent of the price i bought it eh not even the full price eighty dollars only way then i was like okay he definitely must have done something for mine right so i went to scrutinise every single thing okay and then i have a habit right when when i write documents err especially when there s so many tips going on i like have like different versions of documents like one point one one point two one point three and every time i have a new version i will i will imagine you you hurt yourself and then err so now just to keep your skin right for example i m skinned in terms of cells ah cells microscopic level because like that right okay you get a paper card takes a chunk of a flash off then it comes like that right then it starts to heal what how it heals is that it heals some amount by going more cells for the majority of which is actually not no cells is actually made out of connective tissue not connective tissue is like uh hair is connective tissue to some extent not not not not really uh no but hair is made out of cells is actually made out of dead cells you re right but the dead cells die and connective tissue form over kind of thing i okay it s complicated anyway so like it it s feel feel you re quarreling with tissue right and this connective tissue sometimes overgrow so what happens is that as cells are growing and going tissue is being depersent so it s so from up purely seralurding becomes a mixture of self self and quarreling tissue and then like uh usually right what happens is that there is a control of growth where upon reaching through the through the substation through the surveys manage to get in touch with the school in uh peru so i was like uh i was asking i was talking to her i was like eh i really couldn t find a lot of reviews on uh let s go uh medical university right then uh i really wanted to part with you lah because wait so your title is stop so what officer oh but then pa office is actually very different thing so i just hope that not over you ll you ll that sounds that sounds pretty uh uh n three level job then i was so ready to just drop it you know but then he texted back he was like uh no lah he he sat in the group he s gonna tell me for few days let me put it to this way no he replied me just now sure i ll pass you a detailed sentence okay that s why he replied me but let me give you a bit more details about him as a person it s not it s not he s not a bit childish and he s a bit uh it s like it s disgusting medical stuff right but you know like you know when you get dogs right no no when you get when you buy where you buy dogs big dogs are generally calm lah chill more calm more chill so one dog is like compensate by very aggressive oh freaking aggressive it s like the smallest dog you can get freaking aggressive you punch me one i quite chill i quite cool one lah i ll be like okay whatever you know that s be friends but always he will always say that oh alright one i forgot i forgot and then it s the right way to i don t know whether this is the right as in like i forgot the no i i forgot the right term for this already but if i m wrong is the squeaky will makes the most noise right i ll only complain to you about the her extreme right so that s not a representation of a med kid you know other med kids apart from me right as in like i i put it to you this way it s about interplay right it s about uh ya that s why i say that that problem with you what right i haven t say got problem with i told you right she oh no no no that s it no i try consistently but she was always forgetting that i i m some just happy spend time alone around her you re not sure i don t care but when i say something is wrong something is wrong it s very easy for you to generalise uh opinions and say that like oh you guys are overreacting because you are not at the point and it s not just me apparently what i heard right is that this guy called he also felt the same way towards jolene and the fact that he s actually supposed to even closer to jolene than i am because they they like they are in the same clique ah and stuff like that but he he he honestly he he told me that he felt quite sad that like uh um she s just it s never present mentally this is not just me and i really feel that the you always thinking about when you are making generalise the people that i ve picked your interest what another one and a half hours eh one hour shag shag sh whatever lah whatever lah do you think he will transcribe the conversation that is true he must be called on ttg if the two singaporean become rather extrochemical ah become from well educated people ya it s quite a flat it s quite a flat uh structure structure they are they are company ya they are ya their company structure it s quite a flat but i think cause from what the ceo told me right the company culture is quite it s quite nice like like how to say ya ya ya i know lah i m like but then like the impression that he gave he used the shampoo he didn t use the spray ya oh damn ya but then but then there won t be a lot of opportunities for you to use exfoliate also what right but sometimes the experience might not be the cheapest ya uh huh ya correct correct okay i haven t check the shop back yet though i think can check how you know yay i give you wow it s it s for in it s it s it s a what you call that for it s for the for your loss'"

lah when i travel to france looking forward to that it s really not interesting generation gap what s the biggest similarity or difference between your generation and your parent s generation okay would you say it s more positive or negative neutral lah good for the country in the in having as in globalization is good for the country okay okay um never yeah okay next tikam tikam how do you choose four d or toto numbers um okay what most busybody thing i have ever done i i don t really know like it s it s like small events like like what most busybody thing is so weird there was this guy who just came up of no where when we were in the cemetery you know he told us that his name was yan wei so i thought it was little bit weird yan wei so i kept i kept repeating the name to myself yan wei and i found it really familiar when i got back home it was a very parti it was a very you know weird event okay i ve never gone through it but it s actually losing a loved one so you know i can only imagine how that would be like so yeah that s my um greatest fear in a way ya so i m describe the place i call home in singapore ever changing not e scooters um very different from you know when i was a kid um what s the question again what s what is it again describe i would just say ever changing singapore should become the next hub for financial hub the green movement being an example for the rest of the world in the sense of environmentally friendly but i think it s already moving to the direction it s good i mean ya what can be improved cars maybe making a bigger switch from your normal oh yeah definite okay yeah think is just some yes look at yeah shanghai and beijing yeah and here s the thing you know it make me think of this company call yeah tense tencent so tencent runs this application in china that ru yes exactly and you know everything that they do about their payments about what yes yes i would say probably who would you like to answer i don t know you seem like you wanted to answer it okay oh sorry what s the which singaporean sun yanzi i love her songs and i love how she is really humble and you know live a normal life even though of her global success what s that oh taxi drivers they are really interesting people you know they like to they like to talk about everything most interesting is about this guy who would talk about all his gambling yes and he will talk about his gambling experiences in marina bay sands so you know it s really it was really funny the guy such character and he would just hmm okay right beside you okay yes exactly yeah to chat with her yeah ya exactly you know on this point i had an experience in the past where i was with the force police force and this lady would always call up to the police station and talk about talk about talk about all sorts of things so then she would complain about this and complain about that give me one point thanks alright t f r what would you rather have kids or pets why wow you getting all serious with me okay so wow you re getting all serious with me best subject what s that called social studies worst subject math i suck at numbers i suck at details um yeah so you know what what s your take on on on on on success you know the say that love makes the world go round or love is what drives the world i believe in that we will bring love to the world russell peters ya don t we all go through that period in our primary or secondary school when we read russell peters yes that they are have always been experiencing they don t move out of that circle or that space so what happens is that they do not see the all the other areas which you know could like which which is there you know so people who place safety and security as the top priority are usually the people who may not be as fulfilling i d say ya so basically i just spend my time there lah playing around with all the other kids from the other the other stores yeah thus good good times kaypoh so what s the most busybody thing you ve ever done maybe you can share oh really i i also had a similar experience yeah the other time i think was in geylang i was walking down the road and basically i heard i heard this these boys this boys right i was just eating like frog porridge with a friend and there was this banana tree that s she actually just set me down talk me through things and actually forgave me and i m in that s a definitely with the consent of the other student lah so that itself actually made me learn to think more about my own actions primary six yeah yeah of course i felt different left a great great impact on me lah of course i love her so much she is like the best teacher you can never find you know what what about you do you have any yeah of course time to time i still visit her bring her some stuff missus jaiya yeah hmm yes precisely that s exactly what i learn as well yeah bonding through struggles and also leading with example yes precisely i definitely to the best of my ability yeah that s hmm makes you feel good ah yeah okay king of fruits what s the most number of durians you have ever eaten at one go do you even eat durians the seeds okay let s do the whole okay let s do seeds then thirty probably ten i try to eat lesser lah definitely i want i want to stay in shape one ya families to where they think they deserve to be at that means of a higher level lah bring them a better better life yeah so and so forth okay so if you could send a message to a specific group of singaporean who would you address and what would you say yes gambling habits you know i come to realize that a lot of taxi drivers right they are just i mean right now i would say it s more like grab what what they they normally just do this for fun they did realize they are there are a lot of people who don t have much to do and so they re just trying to find my neighbor next door is this she s a wonderful lady she s in her seventies contributed to society she s to be a teacher they re really good lah and in good in good people yeah and well thing about you think about her is i would say for neighbors always be yeah harmony lah in their work and life that way yeah be more i would i would think there d be more value lah to that than to just be earning okay yeah okay okay yeah i get you that s what that s what people say but ya and i don t don t really believe in it lah i mean do you ya okay so when was the last time you actually interacted with a foreigner oh what do you actually talked about fulfilment fulfilment ya i mean definitely if i can fulfilment is when you can achieve something larger than yourself like what i told you earlier on basically success that s fulfilment that s interesting ya i ll give you a one point dressing ya i mean i like i like how they use to dress it to me comfort is more important and what what what they dress in is definitely more comfortable as compared to what we are wearing right now don t you agree yeah of course economy yeah we use to be okay um may none happy state of mind yes i get where you are coming from so in a way they are seeking for like physical stimulation to actually compensate for what ever they can t get mentally you re right okay maybe we can go on to the next question now so why was six years so who s the better cook your mom or your grandmother grandma what what sort of dishes uh huh hello hello hello hello hello hello oh oh oh this that s very soft hello hello hello hello yup yup okay nice nice nice nice nice this okay nice nice it s like they are really working very hard and it s a bit crazy they study harder than any of us can ever study that s why like everybody gets into university not the best because it s ultimately still a bell curve competition right but um uh but the problem is right as i was talking bout my parents uh back then actually even now lah when you get a degree in china but after he came here erm he was working lah he worked for awhile my mum was having me in china err she still had me my dad came here he did work he was part of the construction firm also then err he got out construction firm then he realised he s err his degree was invalid then err did some business related thing mum had me brought err brought me over to singapore much earlier you were just seeing one and you say eh this is not too bad and you re just going for it i think that s a bit too premature as much as as good as much as good as the job sounds and maybe this job is the best sounding one out of everything but ultimately they haven t told you to sign the contract yet there is still time to think about it uh because if you earn based on commission you can earn quite a bit if you work very hard and one thing that err and one thing and one thing that s great about him right and one thing that s great about him is that he works super hard he always work super he always super hard uh ya lah for the family for himself and he he doesn t really know how to spend also he works saves up a lot of money um think that s a really good point about him why did i even talk about this in the first place yeah he was cause we we we we got like a second hand hdb and it was quite expensive also so we ll pay off our loans lah then car also car loans and stuff like that and uh i think coe prices was not very high at that point of time it s it s insane now but imagine back when i was in primary school it s it s really quite it s it s and that s where he end up now lah he s still in sales because he he s the type of guy who who is quite averse to change i don t blame him old people are generally averse to change yup and his personality also kind of averse to change you can t teach a old dog new tricks ah that s the issue but it s the same same kind of product ya that s why that that s why i took the scholarship i cannot i don t want as in like he he s able to break even but not significantly more than even he s still earning some but not not significant amounts for the loans that our family has ma but my mum is doing quite well as not bad lah ya and uh but the problem is that they didn t really buy insurance and stuff like that at a young age cause my dad lah my dad is he s he he doesn t really do a lot of planning you re right he doesn t do a lot of planning so like up to you lor i guess but are you still planning to send out more send out more err resumes so exactly as i said lah where is where is the company ah and what does the company do i still don t understand okay oh where is it that s not too bad but won t it oh sophisticated words you mean not not intricate intricate means detailed uh you you can you even describe words as intricate okay that s a that s a better description no sorry your your your voice is not oh your voice sounds so singlish so singaporean so singaporean so singaporean ya because you re you re trying to imitate someone who is not singaporean because you re trying to imitate someone who is not singaporean that s why it sounds weird because you re singaporean because you sound very singaporean save money get your get your priorities settled first is it okay lor then all all the more i can spend my money happily doing err going to expensive place for hikes if you tell me s that your job is pa my my impression is that you re just gonna do a lot of sai kang honestly speaking like oh uh add this to my calendar like err get this memo written up send to this person or err can you take the minutes for this meeting send to everyone like that doesn t sound like a job to me that s why get then then know your job better you are you are too you are too okay with things already there are terrible mentors mine s terrible right and there are good mentors good mentors are generally very very responsive very very give a lot of good directions people with good mentors already finish the project long time ago already you know right they already started studying already my my mentor is the worse i m not kidding you is four of us what one or two a bit only oh well okay i m honestly kinda excited to start studying also it s like it s like you lor as in ah i must go to work i m so tired oh i shouldn t have taken the the second shift then i ll be like i can t wait to do work again oh ridiculous lah you that s why i every time you you say yes i ll be like you sure you want or not then you say number five easy to share with other people your things there s a lot of ways in which cloud storage is better no the okay you can the only problem with cloud storage is that moving too big a file that is too big of a s err too big a size is uh depends on the speed of your internet connection and your computer err uh we should have told them when he came in lah honestly you you don t as as in we can tell them that we can tell them that like it was supposed to be but i don t mind staying a bit longer just get this over and done with why you so lazy i am a generator of conversation i keep on generating conversation anyway ya cloud storage is in fact better you re paying thirty dollars a year what if it comes then then after that you start regretting then then then then that will be quite sad and also you you are tied at least to the probation period it s for the company lah aww that s not too bad um that that s a good thing about that i guess but the the downside is that during that period of time you won t be sending any resumes lah well true true i ll but the only issue is that with that right is that uh no lah in fact it s more secure up on the whoops sorry sorry up on the on the cloud storage than it is on the hard disk of course you can lose and damage your hard disk number two your hard disk can may have corrupted files it s really cool it s they really have a whole lot of things in place if you it really depends on you lah do you have any files that you wanna save don t don t tell me snaps do you have any important files you can technically still keep on using google drive lah and if you actually really like google drive that much i guess can consider getting a cloud storage lor let me google cloud storage err actually i think dropbox is better than google drive which one do you think like more why ya but the good thing about google drive is that it s much easier to concurrently err edit documents err dropbox is uh the most basic the the one level above basic for individuals is nine ninety a month tom and paul s cafe peach juice wah i m really feeling quite tired this quite cute ah i thought you said this was ntu s ntu s stuff oh to email everyone oh okay that s that s okay interesting but do you know do you know what this project is about huh that s odd i think you missed out one huge part of it right that says please kindly turn off your cell phone or at least silent mode so it don t vibrate alright then you you you come up with the conversation topic come we talk about it i won t send you this thing then save image wah damn cute sia this one it s a woman what woman okay true uh it s so hard to focus you you come up come up with a topic i send to you first kathmandu kathmandu is damn cool it s like a mixture of indian and indian and chinese culture a lot of monks there also but then kathmandu is very india like to to a point where it s very very like a lot of people say that it s very crowded very and i don t wanna watch on the computer because if i watch on the computer it s means that is even more reason for me to pro procrastinate aww man what a dilemma right you can be my personal assistant you can help me to down download every single episode i m hungry i m not hungry my stomach is moving ya of course have you never been to serangoon nex it s like it s like it s like buying okay imagine right imagine you re buying investment you want to know about your investment right cause you don t want to it is same thing something similar you re putting an investment your investment is the job that you re getting this is not a part time job my friend this a full time job in which you want to gain experience even if you don t want to stay there full time you want to gain experience from it this not any part time job where you just wanna earn the money and zao is it at the place that i was talking about it s pretty good stuff eh no go to the one that i recommend it s better go early no we didn t go early we go right at the time we wanted to go which is at around five plus so you wanna go err jb we can go i think in two two months two and a half months time i ll be relatively freer cause of err fam family medicine posting cause you ll be working is it i i ve tried asking before i i ve tried asking before in the places i have asked which is not that many i i i give it i give it to you but the places i ve asked they don t have it what wait no not the current one oh it s okay what oh okay because different people cook it it s quite inconsistent yeah i i always see different people cooking it i ve never i would never really go out to eat ban mian ban mian is but more eh you haven t bought your thing right the the hard disk you buy later lah you want buy later you planning to get popular right i got popular membership i told you before what you never pay attention you always forget you don t care i never forget no i always i always remember stuff please please i very excited to get the watch the watch i so excited i am getting it it s coming on friday slash saturday i was telling you you want buy or not i sell to you first i will sell eighty percent of the price i bought it at not even the full price eighty dollars anyway then i was like okay he definitely must have done something for mine right so i went to scrutinise every single thing okay and then i have a habit right when i when i write documents err especially when there s so many edits going on i need to have different versions of document like one point one one point two one point three and every time i have a new version i will i will imagine you hurt yourself and then err so now there s a gap between in skin right for example from here become like that in terms of cells ah cells microscopic level becomes like that right okay you get a paper cut it takes a chunk of your flesh off then it becomes like that right then it starts to heal it what how it heals is that it heals some amount by growing more cells but the majority of which is actually acellular no cells it s actually made up of connective tissue nope connective tissue is like err your hair is connective tissue to some extent not not not really err no hair is not made of cells it s actually made up of dead cells you re right but the dead cells die and the connective tissue form over it kind of thing aiya okay it s complicated anyway it doesn t matter so like it it s it s filled connective tissue right and this connective tissue sometimes overgrow so what happens is that as cells are growing a connective tissue is being deposition so from a purely cellular thing becomes a mixture of cellular cells and connective tissue and then like uh usually right what happens is that there is a control of growth where upon reaching and through the through the subscription through the service managed to get in touch with the school in uh peru so i was like err i was asking i was talking about her i was like eh i really couldn t find a a lot of reviews on err glasgow glasgow medical university alright then uh i really wanted to find reviews lah because wait so your title is the so what officer okay but then pa and office executives are very different things you know i just hope they don t overwork you lah cause that sounds that sounds pretty tough err err entry level job then i i was so ready to just dropped it you know but then he texted back he was like err no no he he say in the group he s gonna dao me for a few days let me put to this way well he reply me just now sure i ll pass you the details later okay that s what he reply me but let me give you a bit more details on him as a person it s not it s not weird he s a bit childish and he s a bit err it s like it s like when we we discussing medical stuff right but you know like you know when you get dogs right no no when you get but buy when you buy dogs big dogs are usually calm lah chilled uh more calm more chilled small dogs they compensate by roar very aggressive ah he s freaking aggressive he s like the smallest dog i can get a freaking aggressive will punch me one i quite ch i quite cool one lah but like okay whatever you know let s be friends but always he ll always say that oh ri one wah i forgot i forgot it is the right way to i don t know whether this is the right as in i forgot the no i i forgot the right term for this already but if i m not wrong is the squeaky wheel makes the most noise right i ll only complain to you about the the extremes right so this is not a representation on med kids do you know other med kids apart from me right that s not enough for friendship as in like i i put it to you this way it s about interplay right it s about err ya that s why i say i don t have problem with you what right i never even say i got problem with you i told you right she oh no no err err as in no i try consistently but she was always forgetting that i even existed i am someone who just happily spend time alone in the room don t jio me for dinner sure i don t care but when i say something is wrong something is wrong lah i feel it s very easy for you to make generalized uh opinions and say that like oh you guys are overreacting right cause you are not in the position and is not just me apparently what i heard right is that there is some guy call ping chong he also felt the same way towards jolene and the fact that he s actually supposed to be even closer to jolene than i am because they they like they are the same clique ah stuff like that but he he honestly he told me he felt quite sad i liked her uh she just is never present mentally this not just me and i really feel that the it s always thinking bout when we are making generalisation we are always making generalisations about the people that have piqued your interest wah another one and half hours eh one hour shag shag shag whatever lah whatever lah do you think he will transcribe the conversation that is true it must be quali quantitative right there s no singaporean i come from a well educated background i come from a well educated background no lah just kidding ya it s quite a flat it s quite a flat err structure the other company ya their their company structure is quite flat but i think cause from what the ceo told me right the company culture is quite is quite nice like like how to say ya ya ya i know lah i understand but then like the impression that he gave me you didn t use the shampoo or you didn t use the spray ya oh damn ya but then but then there won t be a lot of opportunities for you to use expedia also what right but sometimes expedia might not be the cheapest ya uh huh ya correct correct okay i haven t check the shopback yet though i think can check how you know yay i give you why is is for in is is is is a what you call that for is for the for your lost\"\"\""
